### Small World Experiment.
This talks about the person who found the problem.  He also proposed the six degrees of separation problem.  The page also talks about
the experiment Milgram did: The basic procedure, results, and critics.  The page also goes into depth about how other fields have used
this problem.  For example, the social network has used it to "mediate the connections between the vast majority of otherwise weakly connected individuals."  Others, use the small world phenomenon for disease trnsmission, mathematicians also use the small world phenomenon to solve problems and critique it.
