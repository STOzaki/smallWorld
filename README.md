# Small World
### All Paths
1. This is the cite I got the program from. [Location](http://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/45graph/AllPaths.java.html)

### Small World Experiment.
This talks about the person who found the problem.  He also proposed the six degrees of separation problem.  The page also talks about
the experiment Milgram did: The basic procedure, results, and critics.  The page also goes into depth about how other fields have used
this problem.  For example, the social network has used it to "mediate the connections between the vast majority of otherwise weakly connected individuals."  Others, use the small world phenomenon for disease trnsmission, mathematicians also use the small world phenomenon to solve problems and critique it.

### Modifications
1. Made a prompt to handle the questions of what the program should do. [prompt](https://github.com/STOzaki/smallWorld/blob/master/src/smallworld/AllPaths.java#L67) [called](https://github.com/STOzaki/smallWorld/blob/master/src/smallworld/AllPaths.java#L46)
2. Made a try and catch in case someone misspell. [try](https://github.com/STOzaki/smallWorld/blob/master/src/smallworld/AllPaths.java#L48) [catch](https://github.com/STOzaki/smallWorld/blob/master/src/smallworld/AllPaths.java#L51)
3. Made the color of the catch change to red and then back [red](https://github.com/STOzaki/smallWorld/blob/master/src/smallworld/AllPaths.java#L52) [black or defualt](https://github.com/STOzaki/smallWorld/blob/master/src/smallworld/AllPaths.java#L53)
4. Made a method that finds the shortest or longest path. [shortLong](https://github.com/STOzaki/smallWorld/blob/master/src/smallworld/AllPaths.java#L156) [called](https://github.com/STOzaki/smallWorld/blob/master/src/smallworld/AllPaths.java#L113) [short or long](https://github.com/STOzaki/smallWorld/blob/master/src/smallworld/AllPaths.java#L78)
5. Made a method to print the shortest method. [printingShort](https://github.com/STOzaki/smallWorld/blob/master/src/smallworld/AllPaths.java#L212) [called](https://github.com/STOzaki/smallWorld/blob/master/src/smallworld/AllPaths.java#L136)
6. Added a method to print all of the paths. [printPath](https://github.com/STOzaki/smallWorld/blob/master/src/smallworld/AllPaths.java#L190) [called](https://github.com/STOzaki/smallWorld/blob/master/src/smallworld/AllPaths.java#L162) [user's choice](https://github.com/STOzaki/smallWorld/blob/master/src/smallworld/AllPaths.java#L82)
7. Made a method to print to work for digraph. [printDigraph](https://github.com/STOzaki/smallWorld/blob/master/src/smallworld/AllPaths.java#L200) [called](https://github.com/STOzaki/smallWorld/blob/master/src/smallworld/AllPaths.java#L133) [decision](https://github.com/STOzaki/smallWorld/blob/master/src/smallworld/AllPaths.java#L88)
